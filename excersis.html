        <p>QUESTION  <br>
            why should we use async await when we can fetch with promise</p>
            --------------------------------------------------------------------
        <li>They handle asynchronous operations (like fetching data)</li>
        <li>There are  diffirence in how they are written and understood </li>
        <br>
        <li>Promise works well but <br>
        can be messy with lot of chaining (then inside then )</li>
        <li> Slightly harder to read/debug when deeply nested </li><br>
        <li> async/await</li>
        <li> Cleaner and easier to read></li>
        <li>Feels like regular synchronous code</li>
        <li>Easier to handle complex logic and error handling</li>
        lastly async/await is more preferable because,
        its more clear and readable code than Promise
    </ol>
